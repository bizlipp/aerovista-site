# AeroVista - Accessibility & Performance Documentation

## Phase 5: Accessibility & Performance Implementation

This document outlines the accessibility and performance improvements implemented in Phase 5 of the AeroVista website modernization project.

## Accessibility Improvements

### 1. Focus Management

- Enhanced keyboard focus styles with `:focus-visible`
- Improved skip links for keyboard navigation
- Added explicit focus indicators for all interactive elements

### 2. Screen Reader Support

- Added appropriate ARIA attributes (`aria-label`, `aria-hidden`, `aria-current`, etc.)
- Added semantic HTML elements and roles
- Implemented visually hidden labels for form elements

### 3. Contrast and Typography

- Improved text contrast ratios 
- Added text shadow utilities for better readability on gradients
- Ensured minimum text sizing for readability

### 4. Form Accessibility

- Added explicit labels for all form inputs
- Enhanced form validation with accessible error messages
- Improved focus states for form controls

### 5. Motion and Animations

- Enhanced `prefers-reduced-motion` support
- Added animation toggle for users with vestibular disorders
- Reduced animation intensity for better user experience

### 6. Structure and Navigation

- Improved semantic HTML structure
- Enhanced ARIA landmarks for better navigation
- Added proper heading hierarchy

### 7. Print Styles

- Optimized for print with better contrast
- Removed unnecessary elements when printing
- Improved layout for printed pages

## Performance Improvements

### 1. Resource Loading

- Implemented font loading optimization with Font Loading API
- Added resource hints (`preload`, `preconnect`, `dns-prefetch`)
- Prioritized critical rendering path

### 2. Rendering Optimization

- Implemented content-visibility for off-screen content
- Added hardware acceleration for smoother animations
- Created responsive image container with predefined aspect ratios to prevent CLS

### 3. Animation Performance

- Optimized animations for better rendering performance
- Added class to disable animations during initial load
- Implemented staggered animation loading

### 4. JavaScript Optimization

- Added intersection observer for lazy loading
- Implemented performance measurement
- Delayed loading of non-critical resources

### 5. Layout Stability

- Prevented Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) with explicit dimensions
- Added font loading optimization to prevent layout shifts
- Used containment for better rendering performance

### 6. Progressive Enhancement

- Added fallbacks for browsers that don't support modern features
- Implemented feature detection for CSS and JavaScript
- Created graceful degradation for older browsers

## File Structure

The improvements are organized into the following files:

- `css/accessibility.css` - Centralized file for accessibility styles
- `css/performance.css` - Optimizations for better loading and rendering
- `css/animation-controls.css` - Controls for animation preferences
- `performance.js` - JavaScript performance enhancements

These files are imported in the main CSS and JavaScript to ensure they're applied across the site.

## Usage Guidelines

### Accessibility Classes

- `.sr-only` or `.visually-hidden` - Hide visually but keep accessible to screen readers
- `.high-contrast-text` - Improve text contrast
- `.text-on-gradient` - Improve readability on gradient backgrounds
- `.contrast-border` - Add high contrast borders

### Performance Classes

- `.cv-auto`, `.cv-section`, `.cv-cards` - Apply content-visibility
- `.hardware-accelerated` - Force hardware acceleration
- `.priority-img` - Load image with high priority
- `.img-container` - Responsive container with predefined aspect ratio
- `.lazy-section` - Lazy-loaded section with fade-in effect

### Animation Control

- `.enable-animations` - Explicitly enable animations (overrides reduced motion)
- `.animation-controls` - Container for animation toggle button
- `.animation-toggle` - Button to toggle animations

## Implementation Status

These improvements have been applied to:

- ✅ Core CSS architecture
- ✅ Main HTML files
- ✅ JavaScript enhancements
- ✅ Form elements
- ✅ Navigation components

## Next Steps

After completing Phase 5, the next phases will be:

- Phase 6: Template + Footer/Header Unification
- Phase 7: Analytics and metadata implementation
