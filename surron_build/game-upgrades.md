## Fishing System Improvements

### Dynamic Weather System

A fully dynamic weather system has been implemented that affects fishing conditions:

- **Weather conditions**: Sunny, cloudy, rainy, stormy, and foggy
- **Seasons**: Spring, summer, fall, and winter
- **Time of day**: Morning, day, evening, and night

Each environmental factor affects:
- Catch rates
- Fish availability
- Rarity chances
- Visual presentation

The weather changes dynamically during gameplay, creating a more immersive and varied experience.

### Expanded Fish Catalog

The fish catalog has been significantly expanded:

- 18 different fish species across 5 rarity levels
- Each fish has specific properties:
  - Value (SurCoins)
  - Size (affects catch difficulty)
  - Seasonal availability
  - Weather preferences
  - Time of day activity patterns
  - Special effects when caught

### Skill-Based Fishing Challenges

Fishing now includes interactive mini-games based on the fish type:

- **Timing challenges**: Press at the right moment to hook fish
- **Reeling challenges**: Rapidly press to reel in strong fish
- **Balancing challenges**: Keep indicator in target zone
- **Patience challenges**: Hold steady for a duration

Challenge difficulty scales based on:
- Fish rarity
- Fish size
- Player equipment quality

### Fishing Spots & Equipment

- Multiple fishing locations with different fish populations
- Upgradeable fishing equipment:
  - Rods (affects cast distance and reeling speed)
  - Lures (affects bite rate and rare fish chance)

### Special Effects & Rewards

- Rare fish can trigger special effects:
  - Bonus currency multipliers
  - XP bonuses
  - Character relationship improvements
  - Quest triggers
- Session-based rewards that scale with performance:
  - XP based on session length and rarity of catches
  - Bonus currency at session end
  - Chance to earn special equipment

## Bike Tuning Enhancements

### Component-Based Tuning

The bike tuning system has been enhanced with a component-based approach:

- **Battery Pack**: Voltage, capacity, weight
- **Controller**: Amperage, heat management, programmability
- **Motor**: Power, torque, efficiency
- **Cooling System**: Heat dissipation, weight, reliability
- **Frame Modifications**: Weight reduction, strength, style

Each component can be tuned individually and contributes to the overall performance.

### Tuning Profiles

Multiple tuning profiles with different target values:

- **Balanced Performance**: Good all-around performance
- **Maximum Speed**: Tuned for top speed
- **Off-Road Performance**: Maximum torque and durability
- **Maximum Range**: Optimized for battery efficiency
- **Charlie's Special**: Extreme performance tuning (difficult)

Each profile has different difficulty and reward tiers.

### Interactive Tuning Challenges

Skill-based tuning challenges that affect component performance:

- **Voltage Adjustment**: Precise control challenge
- **Power Balancing**: Balance power and heat
- **Thermal Tuning**: Optimize cooling system
- **Torque Optimization**: Find the sweet spot
- **Weight Reduction**: Reduce weight without compromising strength

### Player Skill System

Player skills that improve over time:

- **Tuning Precision**: General tuning accuracy
- **Heat Management**: Cooling system effectiveness
- **Voltage Control**: Battery tuning skill
- **Weight Optimization**: Frame modification skill

### Enhanced Rewards

- Profile-based rewards scale with performance
- Special parts and tools unlock at high performance levels
- Character relationship improvements with Charlie
- Saved builds with performance history

## Integration Guide

To implement these enhancements, the following new files have been added:

- `fish-catalog.js`: Comprehensive fish database
- `weather-system.js`: Dynamic environmental system
- `enhanced-fishing.js`: Core fishing mechanics integration
- `tuning-challenges.js`: Enhanced bike tuning system

### Fishing System Integration

```javascript
// Import the enhanced fishing system
import enhancedFishing from './game/enhanced-fishing.js';

// Start a fishing session
const sessionData = enhancedFishing.startFishing();

// Cast the line
enhancedFishing.castLine(power, angle);

// Check for fish bite
const hasBite = enhancedFishing.checkForBite();

// Complete a challenge
const result = enhancedFishing.completeChallenge(fishId, {score: 85});

// End fishing session
const summary = enhancedFishing.endFishing();
```

### Bike Tuning Integration

```javascript
// Import the enhanced tuning system
import enhancedTuningGame from './game/tuning-challenges.js';

// Start tuning session with profile
const tuningData = enhancedTuningGame.startTuning('speed');

// Update a component parameter
enhancedTuningGame.updateComponent('batteryPack', 'voltage', 72);

// Complete a tuning challenge
const result = enhancedTuningGame.completeChallenge(challengeId, {value: 80});

// Evaluate the final build
const evaluation = enhancedTuningGame.evaluateBuild();

// Save the build
const savedBuild = enhancedTuningGame.saveBuild('My Speed Build');
```

## Developer Notes

### Performance Considerations

- The weather system is designed to run efficiently with minimal overhead
- Fish selection algorithms use weighted randomization for natural distribution
- Challenge systems are modular and can be extended with new types

### Future Enhancements

Planned features for future updates:

1. **Fishing Tournaments**: Competitive events with leaderboards
2. **Gear Crafting**: Combine materials to create custom equipment
3. **Advanced Tuning**: Specialized tuning for racing, stunts, etc.
4. **Character Quest Integration**: Special activities with Billy and Charlie
5. **Mobile Controls**: Touch-optimized controls for the minigames

### Known Issues

- Weather system requires importing constants for toast notifications
- Some special effects might need additional character integration
- Building a path from tuning challenges to actual bike performance
