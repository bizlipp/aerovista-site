"Battery,""72V Lithium Battery Pack (Internal BMS) – 20s Li-ion pack designed to fit in frame, ~3–4 kWh capacity (e.g. 45–60Ah)."",""Sur-Ron stock 60V 32Ah battery (20s upgrade needed)"",""$1,599 – ChiBatterySystems 'Gladiator 72V 45Ah' (upgrade pack) chibatterysystems.com"",""$2,199 – EBMX 72V 42Ah 'Worx' Battery (high-discharge pack) parts.electriccyclerider.com"",""A 72V pack provides higher voltage for more speed/power but must fit the frame. ChiBattery’s 45Ah is slightly lower cost per capacity, using quality cells and fits the stock tray. EBMX’s 42Ah is a premium pack built for very high discharge (up to ~15 kW tunes), with robust build and BMS. Higher capacity gives longer range but adds weight. Ensure the BMS and physical dimensions are compatible with the frame."""
