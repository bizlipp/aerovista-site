      "Sourcing Option 1 (Price - Vendor)": "$1,300 – FactoryZ (OEM full frame kit) factoryz.co",
      "Sourcing Option 2 (Price - Vendor)": "$1,190 – SurRonshop (OEM main frame only) surronshop.world",
      "Notes on Quality/Compatibility Tradeoffs": "OEM quality frame. Full kit includes all frame sections; buying main frame alone (second option) requires purchasing the swingarm separately. The OEM frame is robust; no known \"high-performance\" alternative frame, but used or clone frames can save cost with possible trade-offs in condition."

      "Notes on Quality/Compatibility Tradeoffs": "Stock motor is reliable for ~6–8 kW bursts. The KO upgrade motor allows far higher power (10–12 kW or more) with improved torque and cooling, but at a much higher cost. Note that the upgraded motor may require an upgraded controller and careful setup."

      "Notes on Quality/Compatibility Tradeoffs": "A 72V pack provides higher voltage for more speed/power but must fit the frame. ChiBattery’s 45Ah pack is slightly lower cost per capacity and fits the stock tray, while EBMX’s 42Ah pack is a premium build tuned for high-discharge applications. Higher capacity (Ah) gives longer range but adds weight – be sure the BMS and dimensions match the frame."
