## 🧠 Tone & Storytelling

**Mood**  
Dramatic poses meet dumb situations — like a detective noir where the mystery is:  
_“Where did we leave the fishing poles?”_

**Dialogue**
- Deadpan  
- Confused  
- Occasionally philosophical  
- Often in zingers or back-to-back awkward silences

**Cinematic Panels**
- Styled like a graphic novel meets storyboard  
- Uses symmetry, mid-zoom shots, and vanishing points (e.g. stair descents)
