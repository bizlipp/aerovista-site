## Notes for Developers
- Always use relative paths for imports, considering the actual file structure
- When adding new slices, update both the slice file and the `gameStore.js` file
- XP coins should be added in the chapter files with consistent ID patterns (`ch1_coin1`, `ch2_coin1`, etc.)
- Adventure scenes should use the standard scene structure with appropriate callbacks
